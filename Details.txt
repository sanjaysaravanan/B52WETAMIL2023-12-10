  1. Promise: ( In-Built Object )
    Object to understand the completion(or failure) of an asynchronous event/operation

    MDN-> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

    State:
      pending --->  initial state, neither fulfilled(success) nor rejected(failure).

      fullfilled ---> meaning that the operation was completed successfully with a value

      rejected ---> meaning that the operation failed with a reason

      whenever a promise is getting rejected it will throw an error

    methods:
      then ---> executed when the promise is fullfilled/resolved
      catch ---> executed when the promise is rejected/unfullfilled
    
    Chaining --> returning an promise from resolvement in parent promise
    if any chained promise gets rejected it is handled by the catch at the tail of the chain
      execution time --> sum of time taken by all chained promises

    All --> Independent Promise triggered simultaneously/parallel
      execution time: Maximum time among all the promises

    Any --> trigger independent promises
      resolve is success when any one is resolved
      exeution: Time taken first resolved promise
      value returned: resolved value of the first promise
      Error: All Promises rejected

  3. Fetch & then
    Fetch -> Interface to make an api call
      response as promise .then 
        --> convert response to json(response.json()) as promsie .then 
        -> (json -> operation on json)

    Session Task:
      use restcountries API console all the country names & flags
